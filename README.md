# Sentiment_Analysis_YTcomments
Sentiment Analysis of YouTube Comments Using Python & TextBlob.
This beginner-friendly project allows you to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of YouTube-style comments using simple Python tools like Pandas and TextBlob.
With just a few lines of code, you can:
1) Load a .csv file containing user comments
2) Automatically classify each comment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral
3) Export the results into a new file for reporting or visualization
This project is a great starting point for anyone new to Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, or working with real-world text data. It helps track user sentiment, monitor content performance, and can easily be extended with charts or ML models.
